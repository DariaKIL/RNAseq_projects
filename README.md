# RNA-Seq Projects Repository

Welcome to the RNA-Seq projects repository! This repository contains a collection of pet projects focused on various RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data analysis approaches. Each folder within this repository corresponds to a different project, where you'll find comprehensive explanations, plots, and detailed notes that I've made for myself and for others who might find them useful.

## Repository Structure

- **One folder = One project:** Each folder contains the scripts, data, and results specific to an individual project. Explore the folders to dive into each RNA-Seq analysis project.

## Project 1: Wound Signaling in Arabidopsis

### Overview

This project, titled **Wound_Signaling_Arabidopsis**, explores the transcriptomic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, particularly focusing on the role of the gene *IMPAIRED SUCROSE INDUCTION 1 (ISI1)* in long-distance wound signaling.

### Study Summary

- **Objective:** To assess the impact of *ISI1* on the wound response by comparing the transcriptomes of wounded *ISI1* mutants with those of wounded wild-type plants.
- **Data Source:** The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available and can be accessed through the [NCBI GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE157938).
- **Experimental Design:**
  - **Conditions:** 
    1. WT - control / *ISI1* mutant plants
    2. W - wounded plants / UW unwounded plants
  - **Replicates:** Each group included three biological replicates.
  - **Sampling:** Distal leaves 13 were collected one hour after wounding leaf 8 in wounded plants, or without any treatment in unwounded plants. 
  - **Sequencing:** The study employed a single-read sequencing design.

## Project 2: Micro-RNA Prediction

This project is currently under development and will be updated soon.
